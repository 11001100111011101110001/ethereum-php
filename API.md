# API development

### Schema based API

In order to keep this API up do date it is build schema based.
(resources/ethjs-schema.json)

Ethereum **JsonRPC Methods** are on ethereum-schema->methods. Implemented in Ethereum class.
Check out the JsonRpcInterface.

To regenerate src/EthMethods.php and src/JsonRpcInterface.php run

```
composer run-script generate-methods
```


**Complex Data types**
are generated  ethereum-schema->objects.
Currently these are:

```
EthSyncing
SendTransaction
EstimateTransaction
CallTransaction
Block
Transaction
Receipt
Filter
FilterChange
SHHPost
SHHFilter
SHHFilterChange
SHHMessage
```

To regenerate run

```
composer run-script generate-complex-datatypes
```
