# API development

### Schema based API

In order to keep this API up do date it is build schema based.
(resources/ethjs-schema.json)

* Ethereum Methods are based on ethereum-schema->methods. Implemented in Ethereum class.
* Complex Data types are generated  ethereum-schema->objects. Generated with public/make_datatypes.php
* Changes to resources/eth-schema.json->objects require to regenerate the datatypes. See: public/make_datatypes.php
* Changes to resources/eth-schema.json->methods currently don't require regeneration.
    * public/make_method_readme.php regenerates the .... readme.
    * public/make_method_docComments.php regenerates src/helpers/ethMethodsDoc.php, which only generates comments.
    * public/make_method_tests.php generates empty test classes only.
