# API development

### Schema based API

In order to keep this API up do date it is build schema based.
(resources/ethjs-schema.json)

Ethereum **JsonRPC Methods** are on ethereum-schema->methods. Implemented in Ethereum class.
Check out the JsonRpcInterface.

To regenerate src/EthMethods.php and src/JsonRpcInterface.php run

```
composer run-script generate-methods
```


**Complex Data types**
are generated  ethereum-schema->objects.
Currently these are:

```
EthSyncing
SendTransaction
EstimateTransaction
CallTransaction
Block
Transaction
Receipt
Filter
FilterChange
SHHPost
SHHFilter
SHHFilterChange
SHHMessage
```

To regenerate run

```
composer run-script generate-complex-datatypes
```


### Testing

```
composer install
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

See phpunit.xml and tests/

**Static tests**
`vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite EthereumPhp`

**Dynamic tests**
Require a Ethereum node to be running.

`vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite EthereumPhpContracts`

You may define `NETWORK_ID` and `SERVER_URL` to perform testing against multiple Ethereum clients.

```
NETWORK_ID='5777' SERVER_URL="http://127.0.0.1:7545" vendor/bin/phpunit
```


### API doc generation

The API documentation is auto-generated by [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/).

```
doxygen Doxyfile
```

There is a online version of this API documentation at [http://ethereum-php.org/dev](http://ethereum-php.org/dev)

Doxygen script does some pre processing which requires GNU-sed on OSX
``` brew install gnu-sed --with-default-names```
